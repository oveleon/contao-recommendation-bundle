2. Create a new recommendation in your archive and fill out
   - Author
   - Date and time are set automatically but can be changed
   - Recommendation text
   - Choose a Rating (1 to 5)
   - Publish the recommendation
   
    ![Admin View: Recommendation](https://www.oveleon.de/share/github-assets/contao-recommendation-bundle/recommendation.jpg)

## Sitemap

Recommendation archives that are not protected and have a jumpTo page will add their published recommendations to your sitemap.xml.
It is recommended to have a title for your recommendations as they are being used to create an alias.
If you do not want certain recommendations to be shown on your sitemap, you can unpublish them.


## Verified recommendations / GDPR

When adding a privacy text to the recommendation form, it will create a mandatory checkbox that visitors have to accept to submit their forms.

Recommendations that are created in the backend are verified by default. 
You have the possibility to set up an activation mail in recommendation forms that will be sent to the visitor. 
The submitted recommendations will not be shown on any list and can not be verified by the administrator.
A cronjob will purge the unverified recommendations after 24 hours.

![Admin View: Unverified Recommendations](https://www.oveleon.de/share/github-assets/contao-recommendation-bundle/unverifiedRecommendations.jpg)

The recommendation form does not save the IP of the user. However, it will save the e-mail-address of a user if they verified their recommendation
with the opt-in token.
